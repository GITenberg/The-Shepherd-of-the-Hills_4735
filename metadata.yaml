description: '"To the beautiful Ozark hill country comes a man from the world of cities.  Among
  the people of the district, with their simple, direct ideals and way of life, he
  finds the peaceful atmosphere he craves, while his more intellectual philosophy
  and character come to be valuable elements in the lives of his new friends.  From
  his relationship with "Sammy" Lane and the Matthews family arise in dramatic fashion
  the gripping situations and thrilling incidents that bring him into a peculiarly
  intimate connection with these people, their country, and their simple life." --Back
